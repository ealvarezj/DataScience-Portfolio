Hola!

Welcome to my Data-Science portfolio where I host some of my favorite projects related to Data Science and Data Analysis.


I'm Elias from Berlin City, In my free time I love to learn and practice using Data Science to solve problems. From simple data analysis tasks using `Pandas` up to developing machine learning models using `scikit-learn`. My preferred tool for working with data is `Python`. I have proficiency in libraries like `pandas`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, `scikit-learn`. As well as querying languages like `SQL` and
`PostgreSQL`. 

In this website you can find some projects related to Data-Science and Data Analysis that I've worked on. All my projects are written using Jupyter Notebooks for easy sharing and collaboration. In order to reproduce this code on your side, I've provided two ways of doing so. If you wish to run the code interactively, please click on the [![badge](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)]() badge to run the code on a binder server in your browser. For a static rendered version, please follow the links provided.
> Note: Since some of my notebooks use `plotly` for generating interactive plots, using a static rendered notebook might not work sometimes. If this is the case, and you are not seeing any output, please consider using the binder link to run the notebook interactively.

## 1. Using SQL to answer business questions. [[more here!]](/DataScience-Portfolio/Projects/sql_advanced)

In this project I analyzed data from a music store saved as an `SQLite database` using only SQL and some python code for creating database connection functions and visualizations. 

## 2. Exploring Ebay Kleinanzeigen car sales data. [[more here!]](/DataScience-Portfolio/Projects/ebay_kleinanzeigen)

In this project I explored the `Ebay Car Sales Dataset` from the [Ebay Kleinanzeigen](https://www.ebay-kleinanzeigen.de/) German website, a division for classified advertisements' website with sections devoted to jobs, housing, services, community service, gigs, and cars. Similar to "Craiglist" in the United States. 

## 3. Clean and analyze employee exit surveys. [[more here!]](/DataScience-Portfolio/Projects/exit_surveys)

In this project I analyzed data from the D`epartment of Education, Training and Employment (DETE)` and the `Technical and Further Education (TAFE) institute` in Queensland, Australia.

## 3. Exploring NYC Open Data. [[more here!]](/DataScience-Portfolio/Projects/Schools)

In this project I fecthed and analyzed data from the `NYC Open Data` using their `socrata Data Platform API`. The Data of used contains records related to New York citie's public schools. Additionally, Geographical data was fechtched as `GEOJson` files and parsed in python using the `geopandas` library.
