# Master Thesis (Data Science Project)

This project contains procedures regarding my master thesis: **"Design and implementation of a machine learning model for the prediction of production times, as an optimization tool for proposal management tasks for die forged products."**. This has been my most comprenhensive Data Science Project until now. Due to a nondisclosure agreement, I am not able to share any data or code regarding the project. For this reason I am only going to provide information about the procedure used in the project.

## Introduction 

Already in the development phase of new high-quality components, engineers are faced with the question of the relationship between function and manufacturing costs. Often, the intended use case and the resulting geometric design of a component determine which manufacturing process might make sense from a production and commercial point of view. The decision-making processes can take a long time, which unnecessarily prolongs the development time of products. One of the main aims in the product development department is to provide customers' development engineers with the most accurate possible cost, requirement, and quality-related advantages of the closed-die forging process to help facilitate quick decision-making. 
A high degree of technical and experiential knowledge is required to meet this standard, which is already applied during the pre-calculation phase through the development of technically sophisticated workflow sequences. It quickly becomes clear what an immense effort hides behind the processing of a customer product request. Information from the most diverse production areas must be collected repeatedly and evaluated and classified concerning its relevance for the best possible manufacturing process. 

This work tries to tackle, employing `Supervised Machine Learning`, the proposal management process in product development. It should be possible to noticeably accelerate the processing time of the pre-calculation process with machine learning methods and at the same time maintain a high quality of the proposal management results. This use case aims to reduce the dependency on Empirical Research for assignment of production times, particularly for the forging process of closed die forged parts, eliminating the need for FEM Simulations to back up first-time proposals.

`Closed die forging` belongs according to the German Institute for Standardisation DIN to the pressing forming processes besides indentation, rolling and open die forging. For the forging process, forging dies with the negative geometries are used. A preheated ingot is put between the dies, force is applied (e.g. forging hammer), the material starts to flow inside the die until the end geometry is filled.

Due to the way materials and especially steel aloys behave in the plasticity state (this is the state in which material deforms and can not return to its initial state) it is not possible using a generalized formula to calculate the required time for the forging process. The plastic deformation behavior from materials cannot be linearly explained. Depending on temperature, chemical composition of the material at varying strain rates, the amount of force needed to achieve the desired true strain varies. Below is a Comparison of flow curves for a C15 steel, with different temperatures and strain
rates.

rates." width="500" %}


Until now, the prediction of the materials' behaviour on the parts' geometry can only be achieved using FEM (Finite element method) simulations. The idea of this project is to find a faster way of achieving a prediction of the forging time for which the deformation force plays an important role. 


## Data availability

Data availability has become nowadays a topic of high relevance for most companies. Technologies like Data Mining are used to find interesting patterns in data that might well already been there, stored and archived or being generated on a daily basis. The learning dataset is composed of data coming from different sources. All parameters were collected for 313 different products, for which all 19 features were available. The resulting dataset is a mixture of continous and categorical variables. This dataset was used as the master dataset. Later on records from the feedback system were joined with the master dataset.

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Data analysis is a crucial step in any Machine Learning problem, is a way to introduce and understand data before moving further to the modeling process. Data analysis provides the analyst with important information about data types, relation between variables in a dataset, their shape, form, distribution as well as descriptive statistics. In data analysis patterns in the data can be discovered by means of numerical tests and visualization techniques. This is in fact one of the most time-consuming steps on any project, since it requires data to be consolidated and prepared for the analysis.

## Model evaluation
There are numerous regression algorithms already implemented in libraries like `scikit-learn` that one can choose from. I chose a simple linear regression models as my baseline model, since it is fast to train due to its vectorized closed form implementation, and easy to interpret. At this point in time categorical variables were removed from the dataset, leaving only continous numerical variables. This was first investigated to see, if only by using numerical variables a good model could be created. The Inclusion of categorical variables requires further preprocessing (encoding) of those variables to a continous space. After getting first results and model accuracy, a set of different models were tested on the same dataset to create a benchmark.

As we can see, benchmarking different models with their standard configurations gives us a pretty good start in terms of accuracy. Accuracy was measured using the **RMSE** (Root Mean Squared Error) metric. These models have still the potential to be optimized. Model optimization goes beyond numerical optimization e.g. **Grid Search** or **Random Search**. Performance of a model can also be improved by carefully performing **feature engineering** and **ensenmbling or stacking** models together. In the table above is possible to see, that relatively simple algorithms like **Random Forest** perform better than more complex and modern approaches like **LGBM (Light Gradient Boosting Machine)**. In fact, the difference in performance between the Random forest Regressor and the CatBoost Regressor is marginal in terms of the RMSE (measured in minutes) one small difference is the training time required for CatBoost is significantly higher, which for the final size of the dataset does not make a lot of difference but if scaled could potentially present an issue.

### Hyperparameter Optimization

Since Random Forest is supported natively by **scikit-learn** we can make use of the **GridSearchCV** and **RandomSearhCV** classes to perform Hyperparameter Optimization. The following table show the optimization proocess for the Random Forest Regressor estimator.

| Hyperparameter                                   | Value range                                                                             | GSearch        | RSearch        |

| Max. features                                    | $$ \{auto, sqrt, log2\} $$                                                              | sqrt           | log2           |
| Max. leaf nodes                                  | $$ \{None, [2,10] \in \mathbb{Z}\} $$                                                   | None           | None           |
| Criterion                                        | $$ \{mse, friedeman mse, mae, poisson\} $$                                              | friedman mse   | mae            |
| ccp alpha                                        | $$ [0, 0.9] \in \mathbb{R} $$                                                           | 0.1          | 0           |

First a **hyperparameter space** was defined. This set of parameter combinations are used by either constructing the cartesian product of all combinations in case of Grid Search. Which is a Brute force approach to optimization where all possible combinations are evaluated. Or using **Random Search**, which randomly (in this case) samples from the hyperparameter space. The results with a 10-fold cross validation are summarized below.

|**Metric**                 | **Resources**                                                                              | GSearch        | RSearch        |

|$$ RMSE $$ with $$ CV = 10 $$        |                                                                                  | **6.510**      | **6.541**      |
|Number of fits with $$ CV = 10 $$ |                                                                                     | 48600          | 2500           |
|Compute time (seconds)  |                                                                                               | 768            | 40.3           |

Taking a look at the results after cross validation is possible to see that, the optimization using either Grid Search or Random Search improved the performance of the model by almost over a minute in reduction in the RMSE (See baseline/unoptimized model in table below). Grid Search uses more ressources since it has to fit a larger number of combinations. Random search from the other side requires a fraction of the number of repetitions needed by Grid Search, thus achieving a similar result. At this point there is not much that one could do to the model in terms of hyperparameter optimization. The next step was to see if modifying the feature space could result in an increase of performance.

### Dimensionality reduction

For the dataset multiple dimensionality reduction `(PCA, LASSO)` and feature selection techniques `(Model based feature selection, Recursive feature elimination)`, were used on the dataset in order to achieve lower dimensionality as well as better performance. At this point the complete dataset was used, by converting categorical variables to numeric, using **OneHot encoding**. The dimension of the dataset changed from 19 to 70 variables. 

#### Model based feature selection
Starting with **Model based feature selection** a supervised algorithm, in this case a random forest regressor was used to learn the feature importance of the model. This method uses a supervised algorithm e.g. a decision tree or random forest as well as linear models, to learn the feature importance of the data in the model before fitting the final estimator. Performing model-based feature selection on the encoded dataset results in a reduction from 70 features to 35. The criteria implemented in scikit-learn library for choosing which variables to keep is based on the Mean decrease in impurity (MDI) metric, which can use any defined impurity measure $$ t(i) $$ , e.g. mean squared error for regression or Gini coefficient for classification.


#### Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE)

Another approach for selecting features is by recursively fitting a model with a smaller subset of features on each iteration. This method uses an estimator e.g. Random Forest regressor and ranks features on each iteration based on some importance metric, for example, the mean decrease impurity used for model-based selection. On each iteration, the least important features are removed until a predefined threshold is achieved.

{% include image.html url="RFE.png" description="Feature selection using the recursive feature elimination cross validated algorithm
(RFECV) on a Random Forest Regressor" width="500" %}

The figure above shows the implementation of Recursive Feature Elimination with Cross Validation (RFECV). The learning curve indicates how the number of predictors in- creases or decreases the performance of the used estimator by inducing variance (adding more predictors), which leads to a decrease in bias. The dotted vertical line marks the point on the graph at which the highest cross-validated train score was achieved, given a certain number of features. In this case, keeping 47 out of 70 variables lead to the most accurate model. One major drawback from using recursive feature elimination and also model-based feature selection is the fact that only a subset of some categorical variables was chosen to be relevant. This is due to the way variables are encoded. Dummy variables are treated as single features and therefore the algorithm does not have information whereas a feature is to be considered as part of a category or just an independent variable. Using only some dummy features in a future model would change the whole dataset definition.

#### GROUP LASSO

To overcome the problem of feature selection with dummy variables, there is a method that addresses this issue, by taking into account grouped features. Group lasso (Group least absolute shrinkage and selection operator)



$$ \begin{equation}
        \sum_{i = 1}^{n} \left(y_{i} - \beta_{0} - \sum_{j = 1}^{p} \beta_{j}x_{ij}  \right)^{2} + \lambda \sum_{j = 1}^{p} \beta_{j}^{2} &\Longleftrightarrow  RSS + \lambda \sum_{j = 1}^{p} \beta_{j}^{2} & \text{(\textbf{Ridge})} \label{eqn:ridge_1}
        \\
        \sum_{i = 1}^{n} \left(y_{i} - \beta_{0} - \sum_{j = 1}^{p} \beta_{j}x_{ij}  \right)^{2} + \lambda \sum_{j = 1}^{p} \left\lvert \beta_{j} \right\rvert &\Longleftrightarrow   RSS + \lambda \sum_{j = 1}^{p} \left\lvert \beta_{j} \right\rvert & \text{(\textbf{Lasso})}\label{eqn:lasso_1}
\end{equation} $$



\noindent
three norms $\ell_{0}$, $\ell_{1}$, $\ell_{2}$ can be considered:

\begin{equation}
    \ell_{0} := \left\lVert \beta\right\rVert_{0} = \sum_{j = 1}^{p} 1\left\{\beta_{j} \neq 0 \right\}, \quad  \ell_{1} := \left\lVert \beta\right\rVert_{1} = \sum_{j = 1}^{p} \left\lvert \beta_{j}\right\rvert, \quad \ell_{2} := \left\lVert \beta\right\rVert_{2} = \left(\sum_{j = 1}^{p} \beta^{2}\right)^{1 / 2}   
\end{equation}

 \noindent   
 the optimization problem becomes:
    
 \begin{align}
    \underset{\beta \in \mathbb{R}^{p}}{\argmin} ~ RSS + \lambda \sum_{j = 1}^{p} \beta_{j}^{2} & \Longleftrightarrow  \underset{\beta \in \mathbb{R}^{p}}{\argmin} ~ \left\lVert \mathbf{y} - \mathbf{X}\beta \right\rVert_{2}^{2} + \lambda \left\lVert \beta\right\rVert_{2}^{2} & \text{(\textbf{Ridge})}\label{eqn:ridge_2}
    \\
    \underset{\beta \in \mathbb{R}^{p}}{\argmin} ~ RSS + \lambda \sum_{j = 1}^{p} \left\lvert \beta_{j} \right\rvert & \Longleftrightarrow  \underset{\beta \in \mathbb{R}^{p}}{\argmin} ~ \left\lVert \mathbf{y} - \mathbf{X}\beta \right\rVert_{2}^{2} + \lambda \left\lVert \beta\right\rVert_{1} & \text{(\textbf{Lasso})}\label{eqn:lasso_2}
 \end{align}

The penalization $\left\lVert \beta\right\rVert_{2}$ used for Ridge is formalized as the $\ell_{2}$ norm  --- usually known as the \textbf{Euclidean norm} --- and $\left\lVert \beta\right\rVert_{1}$ as the $\ell_{1}$ norm --- known as the \textbf{Manhattan norm} --- for lasso. If $\lambda = 0$, then both models solve \glsxtrshort{ols} (c.f. equation \ref{eqn:linear_regression_basic}). $\ell_{1}$ and $\ell_{2}$ constrain the size of the coefficients, e.g. the increase of a coefficient is only possible if it leads to a decrease in the RSS and $\lambda > 0$. In turn, ncreasing $\lambda$ would force some coefficient towards zero. If one would like to reduce the feature space, using the $\ell_{2}$ norm is not a viable solution, since the coefficients would never be able to be exactly zero. By definition, Ridge regression is non-sparse and will contain all zero coefficient for the solution.  The lasso model using the $\ell_{1}$ norm allows for sparsity and as $\lambda$ increases, sparsity increases as well. This regularization approach allows coefficients to be exactly zero and therefore remove those variables from the model, where $\left(x_{i}\beta_{i}\right), ~ \beta_{i} = 0$. Applying lasso to the dataset would result in a sparse model, but the issue of grouped variables remains. Group lasso, which aims exactly at solving that issue solves the following optimization problem \parencites{Yuan2006}{Friedman2010}{Simon2012}{Lim2013}{Meier2008}{AmaralSantos2016}{Tibshirani2017}{Rachmawati2017}:
