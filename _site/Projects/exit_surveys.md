In this project I analyzed data from the Department of Education, Training and Employment [(DETE)](https://www.dese.gov.au/) and the Technical and Further Education [(TAFE)](https://tafeqld.edu.au/) institute in Queensland, Australia.  Data is provided as .csv in my repository.

The aim was to answer the following questions:

- Are employees who only worked for the institutes for a short period of time resigning due to some kind of dissatisfaction? What about employees who have been there longer?
- Are younger employees resigning due to some kind of dissatisfaction? What about older employees?
- Are younger employees resigning due to some kind of dissatisfaction? What about older employees?
- How many people in each career stage resigned due to some kind of dissatisfaction?
- How many people in each age group resigned due to some kind of dissatisfaction?
- Did more employees in the **DETE** survey or **TAFE** survey end their employment because they were dissatisfied in some way?
